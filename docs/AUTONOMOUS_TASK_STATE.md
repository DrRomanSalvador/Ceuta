# CeutIA — Autonomous Task State

**Updated:** 2026-09-14
**HEAD:** `b0368d134f15c6814d8a151fd1049727e71ab136`

This file is an execution-state ledger, not a completion claim. The queue must expand when discovery identifies additional scientifically justified work.

## CURRENT_TASK

Class-level prospective scoring audit: verify that proper-scoring mechanisms reject mathematically invalid probability domains rather than silently clipping endpoints.

## NEXT_TASK

Audit persisted forecast settlement state for temporal/provenance integrity: report identity, submission/deadline/outcome clocks, verification identity, and replay consistency after restart.

## BACKLOG

- Complete repository-wide equivalent-division / zero-denominator scan.
- Complete `ddof=1` and equivalent sample-variance governance inventory.
- Audit all territorial catalog entries for registry/authorization connectivity without collapsing implementation and epistemic registries.
- Trace experimental territorial metrics to every operational consumer and verify output-channel gates.
- Audit temporal leakage across rolling-origin, horizon and retrospective evaluation paths.
- Audit provenance: source identity, acquisition time, publication time, revision/version and corroboration.
- Audit NaN/Inf propagation across numerical outputs and aggregation boundaries.
- Audit cascade/propagation semantics and distinguish observation from causal inference.
- Audit scientific preregistration hashes for deterministic serialization of non-JSON-native specifications.
- Audit persistent scoring/settlement provenance and idempotency boundaries.
- Re-run global security, integration and regression searches after each material mathematical change.
- Synchronize `docs/ENGINEERING_EXECUTION_STATUS.md` with verified repository evidence.

## BLOCKED_TASKS

None currently identified as blocking all independent work.

## COMPLETED_TASKS

- M001 spatial matrix mathematical contract.
- M002 Theil definition and zero-observation semantics.
- M003 calibration-in-the-large endpoint governance.
- M004 targeted `ddof=1` hardening and minimum-sample guards.
- M005 territorial metric registry definitions for the identified disconnected metrics.
- M006 observed propagation-layer cascade depth semantics.
- Additional class-level fixes: bottleneck ties, pressure breadth double-standardization, negative capacity reserve, dependency/sensitivity matrix validation, entropy/temporal minimum-size guards.
- Geometric weighted index zero semantics: positive-weight zero values now produce the mathematically correct zero rather than an epsilon-biased positive value.
- Spatial matrix contract: nonzero diagonal weights are rejected rather than silently rewritten; asymmetric valid row-normalized weights are covered by regression tests.
- Canonical P0 multitemporal hardening: effective validity intervals and revision-aware point-in-time snapshots added without replacing existing `revision_time → publication_time → ingestion_time` availability semantics.
- Versioned Evidence now carries effective validity intervals and serializes them into its canonical representation.
- Point-in-time filtering now respects both availability and effective validity.
- Registry backtest selection now consumes all stored evidence versions and selects the version available at the historical cutoff instead of blindly using the latest-state dictionary.
- General normalized entropy now rejects the mathematically undefined singleton case.
- Territorial pressure concentration no longer uses an arbitrary epsilon to fabricate a nonzero distribution; a uniform profile returns the exact uniform HHI.
- Network density now requires integer graph counts and rejects edge counts above the maximum simple-graph bound.
- Preregistration validation windows now parse ISO-8601 boundaries and compare instants in UTC instead of relying on lexicographic timestamp ordering; naive datetime boundaries are rejected.
- Regression tests cover timezone-offset inversion and naive datetime rejection in preregistration windows.
- Proper-scoring forecasts now require probabilities strictly inside (0,1); endpoint clipping was removed so log-score semantics remain exact rather than silently epsilon-biased.
- Regression tests cover endpoint rejection for reports, expected log loss, and strict-propriety candidate grids.

## VALIDATION_STATE

The current HEAD `b0368d134f15c6814d8a151fd1049727e71ab136` has no associated workflow run reported yet. Do not treat earlier green runs as validation of this or later changes.

## STOP CONDITION

Do not mark `MISSION_EXHAUSTED` until global discovery finds no remaining locally resolvable high-value work, no integration or regression gap remains, and state documentation is synchronized with verified evidence.
